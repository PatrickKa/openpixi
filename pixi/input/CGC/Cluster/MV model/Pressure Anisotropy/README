The files in this folder were used to study the pressure anisotropy in the Glasma.
Averaging over the ensemble of random events needs to be done manually afterwards.

Files pr256_1 - pr256_5 are collisions of "thick" nuclei. The transverse area corresponds to the area of a Au nucleus.
Files pr256_6_* - pr256_8_* are collisions of "thin" nuclei. The transverse area corresponds to fractions of the full
Au nucleus area.
