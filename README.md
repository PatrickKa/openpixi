Introduction
============

![](cpic_overview_small.png?raw=true)

OpenPixi is an open Colored Particle-In-Cell (CPIC) simulator based on real-time lattice gauge theory and the CPIC method. It simulates Yang-Mills fields coupled to moving colored particles, in particular the early stages of heavy-ion collisions within the Color Glass Condensate framework.

A publication using this simulation is available at [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07184), where you also find details about the numerical methods implemented in OpenPixi.

The old Abelian PIC is still available at https://github.com/openpixi/openpixi_pic.

OpenPixi is being developed in Java, with an educational aspect in mind.
