Introduction
============

OpenPixi is an open Colored Particle-In-Cell (CPIC) simulator based on real-time lattice
gauge theory and CPIC. It can simulate Yang-Mills fields coupled to moving colored particles.
The simulation can be used to simulate the dynamics of pure Yang-Mills fields and the early stages
of heavy-ion collisions within Color Glass Condensate framework.

The old Abelian PIC is still available at XXX.

OpenPixi is being developed in Java, with an educational aspect in mind.
